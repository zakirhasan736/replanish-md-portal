			"ReplenishMD was the best investment I made for myself. They provided thorough education and many opportunities for hands-on practice. I appreciated how much they invested their time into me and helped me grow my portfolio as an aesthetic injector. Best of all, I was able to learn at my own pace while feeling supported by my fellow peers and mentors. I highly recommend their courses!",

			"The training program Replenish provided me has been nothing but excellent. The whole experience has been enjoyable and informative. The integration of the anatomy, medical, and pharmaceutical aspect of the injectables really helped me understand and appreciate aesthetics better. I walked into aesthetics with zero experience. Now, I am equipped with the knowledge and skill to provide safe and quality service.",

			"Recently, I had the opportunity to attend a Botox and Dermal-filler certification course through ReplenishMD. Having attended aesthetic courses in the past, I can say that the education and training I received with ReplenishMD was exceptional. The physician training us was extremely passionate, knowledgeable and meticulous. He took the time to educate, perfect skills and improve the confidence of each individual. After attending this course I feel more confident in my skills and my ability to become an expert injector. Very impressed with this course!",

This allowed for experience in different brands of Fillers and Botox along with different techniques including the use of a cannula. I was also given the opportunity to inject both males and females in a variety of age groups. This has been a wonderful learning experience.",
