					<>
						<p>
							Testosterone is a male hormone that is produced
							mostly in the testicles. Just as women have reduced
							production of estrogen and progesterone as they age,
							the production of testosterone also declines in men.
							It is also known as Low-T.
						</p>
						<p>
							Testosterone replacement therapy is used to treat
							low testosterone levels due to age or other factors.
							Low-T replacement therapy helps increase the amount
							of testosterone in a manâ€™s body.
